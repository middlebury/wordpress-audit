parameters:
    # This is the database connection information for the local Symfony
    # application database, *not* the WordPress database. This will be a new
    # database you create as part of the process of installing this application.
    database_host:     127.0.0.1
    database_port:     ~
    database_name:     wordpress-audit

    database_password: ~

    # Edit the list below to include your WordPress database information.
    #
    # The composer script doesn't seem to like nested parameters, so you'll
    # need to edit parameters.yml after running "composer install" and
    # update the values there.
    #
    # 'install_path' is a fully-qualified local filesystem path to a copy of
    # your WordPress site(s) code that this application can read. This will
    # be used to get the list of installed plugins and themes. This should
    # start and end with a / character.
    #
    # 'plugins_path' is a path relative to 'install_path' where your plugin
    # code is kept. This is 'wp-content/plugins/' by default. This should
    # end with a / but not start with one.
    #
    # 'themes_path' is a path relative to 'install_path' where your theme
    # code is kept. This is 'wp-content/themes/' by default. This should end
    # with a / but not start with one.
    #
    # 'branches' is an array of remote branch names that will be used to
    # check for the last time the code of each plugin and theme was updated
    # in your installation of WordPress. The branches are checked in order.
    # For example, in the default configuration, we will check the
    # 'origin/plugins' branch of your project and if there is a plugin or
    # theme file there with an associated commit, that will be used as the
    # last updated date of that plugin or theme. If no such file is present,
    # we will check the 'origin/master' branch and use a date from any
    # commit we find there. If we still can't find a commit, the last
    # update field will be blank.
